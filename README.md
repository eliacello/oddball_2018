Analysis code for 'Musical syntax and semantic processing in dementia' by Benhamou &amp; Warren (in preparation) 2019

# Description 
This experiment was designed to look at the mechanisms of pitch expectations in melodies and their physiological and neuroanatomical correlates in dementia (Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia). 
The final goal was to better understand how patient’s brains extract structural regularities and form expectations over the timecourse of a melody. To do so, we designed a novel paradigm which used different types of pitch deviants embedded in melodies and we measured the level of unexpectedness or ‘entropy’ of these deviant.

# Analysis 
The MATLAB code in this repository was used to preprocess, statistically model, and plot behavioral and eye-tracking data. The data are not included in the repository and, at present, are not publicly available.

The analysis code is presented for example purposes only and is not reproducable as is.
